Let me explain this information in simpler terms:

### What are Edgewise Vibration Conditions?

Edgewise vibrations happen when wind turbine blades move up and down in a certain way. These movements can sometimes damage the blades. Here's what you need to know:

1. Wind Turbine Blades Move
   - Wind turbine blades don't just stay still. They move because of the wind pushing on them.
   - There are different ways blades can move: forward-backward, side-to-side, and up-down.

2. Edgewise Movement
   - Edgewise means moving from one side to the other along the length of the blade.
   - Imagine taking a long ruler and bending it back and forth along its length.

3. Why Does This Happen?
   - Sometimes, the wind isn't blowing straight onto the blade.
   - This creates a problem called "yaw error," which is like the blade being slightly off course.
   - If the wind comes in at an angle, it can make the blade wobble more.

4. How Much Is Too Much?
   - Usually, this isn't a big deal, but if the blade moves too much (more than 15 degrees), it can get damaged.
   - Think of it like a seesaw. If you push it too far, it might break.

5. What Happens When It's Too Much?
   - The blade can get stressed and even crack along its length.
   - This creates a special kind of damage called a "T-shaped" fracture.
   - It looks like a big crack that goes across the blade and down its side.

6. Other Factors That Can Help
   - If the turbine is stopped or idle (not spinning), it's more likely to happen.
   - Wind speeds above 10 meters per second (about 22 mph) can also make this more likely.

Edgewise vibrations in wind turbine blades is a complex phenomenon which may be caused during periods in which the turbine is experiencing a yaw error (difference between nacelle heading and dominant wind direction) greater than 15 degrees during operation.  By summing the operational time during these periods, it is possible to determine the exposure of each turbine to this possible blade damage mechanism.   

- Table 1 describes the parameter filters used to evaluate each 10-minute time stamp in the dataset against the 15 degree yaw error threshold...

Remember, wind turbines are complex machines designed to work in tough conditions. While edgewise vibrations can cause problems, engineers work hard to design them to withstand most situations.
